# Harmony Discord Bot

![GitHub release badge](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/hwsuk/harmony?logo=github)

Harmony is a bot designed to make moderating companion Discord servers for subreddits easier, particularly for trading subreddits. Features include:

- Linking Discord and Reddit accounts with a companion subreddit, to gain privileged roles.
- Allowing moderators to assign roles based on a community member's standing, updating their subreddit flair in turn.
- Searching eBay to help members get an idea of how to price their items.

> This bot is currently designed to run in a single guild. As such, if you want to use it, you will need to host it yourself.

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.11
- MongoDB (with a replica set configured, authentication enabled, and a user authorised to read from and write to a dedicated database)
